/**
 * Look-Ahead Camera Feature Demo
 * 
 * This demonstrates how the new look-ahead camera feature works:
 * 
 * 1. When your mouse is at the center of the screen, the camera stays centered on your hero
 * 2. When you move your mouse toward the edge of the screen, the camera shifts in that direction
 * 3. When your mouse reaches the edge, your hero appears closer to the edge, giving you better visibility ahead
 * 
 * Configuration:
 * - LOOK_AHEAD_THRESHOLD: 0.3 (30% threshold)
 * - This controls how much the camera shifts when your mouse is at the edge
 * - Higher values = more camera shift = hero appears closer to the opposite edge
 * 
 * The feature provides better visibility in the direction you're pointing,
 * making it easier to see enemies and objectives ahead of your movement direction.

// Example usage in the game:
// 1. Move your mouse to the center - camera stays centered on hero
// 2. Move your mouse to the right edge - camera shifts right, hero appears closer to left edge
// 3. Move your mouse to the left edge - camera shifts left, hero appears closer to right edge
// 4. Move your mouse to top edge - camera shifts up, hero appears closer to bottom edge
// 5. Move your mouse to bottom edge - camera shifts down, hero appears closer to top edge

// The camera movement is smooth and interpolated using the existing tween system
// with a duration of CLIENT_CONFIG.CAMERA_TWEEN_DURATION_MS (300ms)
